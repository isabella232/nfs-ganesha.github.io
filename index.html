        <h3>Welcome to the NFS-Ganesha Project.</h3>

<p>The nfs-ganesha project is developing Open Source solutions for NFS and 9P based file servers.
The development of nfs-ganesha started at CEA, Paris, France as a solution to providing NFS access to their tape archive library.  It has grown into a full featured file server that supports NFSv3, NFSv4, and now NFSv4.1 (pNFS).  We have even thrown in 9P protocol support.</p>

<h3>Our active projects and their repositories</h3>

<p>We currently manage three inter-related projects,</p>

<h4>nfs-ganesha</h4>

<p>Nfs-ganesha is the main file server project.  It supports both the NFS and 9P protocols.  The NFS support includes NFSv3 with integrated NLM (lock manager) and MNT (mountd) services.  It also supports NFSv4 including pNFS (v4.1).  For further information, check the <a href="https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/wiki">nfs-ganesha wiki</a>.
The source code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha">git repository</a>.</p>

<h4>mooshika</h4>

<p>Moosika is a relatively new project that provides an RDMA abstraction layer for protocol transport.
It does not yet have a wiki but the
source code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha">git repository</a>.</p>

<h4>ntirpc</h4>

<p>Libntirpc is a significant extension of the Sun tirpc library.  It supports full-duplex RPC over
UDP/TCP.  Its source code is in the <a href="https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/ntirpc">git repository</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Each project is manages separately at this point.  The first place to go is to our IRC channel
and ask questions.  You can also explore the email archive on Sourceforge.</p>

<h3>SourceForge site</h3>

<p>The nfs-ganesha project started at SourceForge.  It is still available at
<a href="http://nfs-ganesha.sf.net">nfs-ganesha at SourceForge</a> although the most up to date information
is found here.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>Philippe Deniel and Thomas Leibovici of CEA are the original authors.  Since then, the contributor
list has grown to include developers from IBM, Panasas, LinuxBox, as well as a number of individuals.</p>

<h3>Contact Us</h3>

<p>You can find most of us on Free-node IRC, channel #ganesha.  Our email archive and listserv is at Ganesha NFS List <a href="mailto:nfs-ganesha-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">nfs-ganesha-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
