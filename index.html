        <h3>Welcome to the NFS-Ganesha Project.</h3>

<p>The nfs-ganesha project is developing Open Source solutions for NFS and 9P based file servers.
The development of nfs-ganesha started at CEA, Paris, France as a solution to providing NFS access to their tape archive library.  It has grown into a full featured file server that supports NFSv3, NFSv4, and now NFSv4.1 (pNFS).  We have even thrown in 9P protocol support.</p>

<h3>Our active projects and their repositories</h3>

<p>We currently manage three inter-related projects,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>nfs-ganesha</p></li>
<li><p>mooshika</p></li>
<li><p>ntirpc</p></li>
</ul><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>TBD</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>Philippe Deniel and Thomas LEIBOVICI of CEA are the original authors.  Since then, the contributor
list has grown to include developers from IBM, Panasas, LinuxBox, as well as a number of individuals.</p>

<h3>Contact Us</h3>

<p>You can find most of us on Free-node IRC, channel #ganesha.  Our email archive and listserv is at Ganesha NFS List <a href="mailto:nfs-ganesha-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">nfs-ganesha-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
