It has grown into a full featured file server that supports NFSv3, NFSv4, and now NFSv4.1 (pNFS).  We have even thrown in 9P protocol support.\r\n\r\n### Our active projects and their repositories\r\nWe currently manage three inter-related projects,\r\n\r\n* nfs-ganesha\r\n\r\n* mooskika\r\n\r\n* ntirpc\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPhilippe Deniel and Thomas LEIBOVICI of CEA are the original authors.  Since then, the contributor\r\nlist has grown to include developers from IBM, Panasas, LinuxBox, as well as a number of individuals.\r\n\r\n### Contact Us\r\nYou can find most of us on Free-node IRC, channel #ganesha.
