{"name":"Nfs-ganesha.github.com","tagline":"User Space NFS and 9P File Server","body":"### Welcome to the NFS-Ganesha Project.\r\nThe nfs-ganesha project is developing Open Source solutions for NFS and 9P based file servers.\r\nThe development of nfs-ganesha started at CEA, Paris, France as a solution to providing NFS access to their tape archive library.  It has grown into a full featured file server that supports NFSv3, NFSv4, and now NFSv4.1 (pNFS).  We have even thrown in 9P protocol support.\r\n\r\n# NEWS\r\nNFS-Ganesha V 2.0 is now available.  Check out the [nfs-ganesha project page](https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/wiki) for more details details including the [Release Notes](https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/wiki/ReleaseNotes_2.0).\r\n\r\n### Our active projects and their repositories\r\nWe currently manage three inter-related projects,\r\n\r\n#### nfs-ganesha\r\nNfs-ganesha is the main file server project.  It supports both the NFS and 9P protocols.  The NFS support includes NFSv3 with integrated NLM (lock manager) and MNT (mountd) services.  It also supports NFSv4 including pNFS (v4.1).  For further information, check the [nfs-ganesha wiki](https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/wiki).\r\nThe source code can be found in the [git repository](https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha).\r\n\r\n#### mooshika\r\nMoosika is a relatively new project that provides an RDMA abstraction layer for protocol transport.\r\nIt does not yet have a wiki but the\r\nsource code can be found in the [git repository](https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha).\r\n#### ntirpc\r\nLibntirpc is a significant extension of the Sun tirpc library.  It supports full-duplex RPC over\r\nUDP/TCP.  Its source code is in the [git repository](https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/ntirpc).\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nEach project is manages separately at this point.  The first place to go is to our IRC channel\r\nand ask questions.  You can also explore the email archive on Sourceforge.\r\n\r\n### SourceForge site\r\nThe nfs-ganesha project started at SourceForge.  It is still available at\r\n[nfs-ganesha at SourceForge](http://nfs-ganesha.sf.net) although the most up to date information\r\nis found here.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPhilippe Deniel and Thomas Leibovici of CEA are the original authors.  Since then, the contributor\r\nlist has grown to include developers from IBM, Panasas, LinuxBox, as well as a number of individuals.\r\n\r\n### Contact Us\r\nYou can find most of us on Free-node IRC, channel #ganesha.
